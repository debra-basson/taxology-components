# TAXology Modules

This folder contains reusable homepage modules, section layouts, and functional components built for the TAXology website. 
These are the custom-designed Elementor + HTML blocks that make up key parts of the TAXology front-end experience.

## Included Module Types

- *Join TAXology sections*
- *Homepage hero and dual-path selector (Individual / Business)*
- *“Ask a Practitioner” widget*
- *Edge-tabs component*
- *Pricing module anchors*
- *Service-grid blocks*
- *Compliance+ highlights*
- *Booking and form-driven CTAs*

Each module is stored as its own .html file for easy reuse and reference.

## Purpose

This folder serves as a portfolio reference for:
- Front-end component design
- Elementor integration
- HTML/CSS layout work
- UX structure for guided tax and compliance journeys

More modules will be added over time as the TAXology site evolves.
